# Tachyons simple_form Initializer

This project contains the default intializer needed to use [simple_form][simple_form] with [tachyons][tachyons css]. It is based off of the custom wrapper in the simple_form [simple_form_wiki][wiki].

In order to use this, install simple form as normal.

Inside of the config > initializers folder, add a new file called tachyons_simple_form.rb. Paste the code from the same named file in this repo.
